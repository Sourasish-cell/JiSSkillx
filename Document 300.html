<h3><p>A drone, in technological terms, is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UASes). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.<p> <br> <p>A drone, in technological terms, is an unmanned aircraft. ... Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.<p> <br> <p>In the recent past, UAVs were most often associated with the military, where they were used initially for anti-aircraft target practice, intelligence gathering and then, more controversially, as weapons platforms. Drones are now also used in a wide range of civilian roles ranging from search and rescue, surveillance, traffic monitoring, weather monitoring and firefighting, to personal drones and business drone-based photography, as well as videography, agriculture and even delivery services.<p></h3>

<h2><u><li>AUTOMATION:</li></u></h2>
<h3><p>Hardware also went beyond construction to include testing of the drone’s sensor equipment. The goal here was to determine the sensor data corresponding to a given orientation. Testing is possible thanks to the Navio+’s available software, allowing for receiving and manipulating of GPS and IMU sensor data prior to my own code being completed. Magnetometer values were used to determine North, South, East, West orientation whereas the accelerometers were used to test for being level.<p><br><p>This was done by comparing the magnetometer values in real time to a compass as the quadcopter was turned in a circle. The magnetometer values in all three axes were recorded for each of the cardinal directions . To simplify movement the drone will only attempt to move in a single cardinal direction at a time so knowing combinations of them for this testing is unnecessary.<p></h3>

<h2><li><u>INTRODUCTION:</li></u></h2>
</ul>
<h3><p>Agricultural drones provide growers, service providers, and ag researchers a fast and efficient way to scout their crops, identify stress, create treatment plans, track plant growth, and much more.<p> <br> <p>Using high-resolution RGB cameras and professional multispectral sensors, drones like the WingtraOne can detect and quantify crop health problems early on. These valuable insights can reduce input costs and boost yield.<p> </h3>
<h2><li><u>UNDERSTANDING THE AGRICULTURAL DRONE MARKET:</u></li></h2>
<h3><p>Agricultural drones help to achieve and improve what’s known as precision agriculture.<p><br><p>This approach to farming management is based on observing, measuring, and taking action based on real-time crop and livestock data. It erases the need for guesswork in modern farming and instead gives farmers the ability to maximize their yields and run more efficient organizations, all while enhancing crop production.<p><br><p>In recent years the cost of agriculture drones has rapidly declined, which has not only led to the explosion of drone use cases in agriculture but has made it a no-brainer investment for modern farmers.<p><br><p>In fact, the agricultural drone market is expected to grow over 38% in coming years. Driven by growing population levels and changing climate patterns, the need for efficient agriculture is only going to become more important.<p><br><p>There are multiple uses for agricultural drones, including:<p><br><p></h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Scouting land and crops.</li></h3>
<li><h3>Checking for weeds and spot treating plants.</li></h3>
<li><h3>Monitoring overall crop health.</li></h3>
<li><h3>Managing livestock and monitoring for health issues</li></h3>
<li><h3>And more Drones are equipped with technology like propulsion systems, infrared cameras, GPS and navigation systems, programmable controllers, and automated flight planning. Plus, with custom-made data processing software any collected information can instantly be put to use towards better management decisions.</li></h3>

<h2><u><li>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:</li></u></h2>
</ul>
<h3>The author would like to thank the following people for their help and support through the duration of the project. Dr. Mainak Biswas for selecting me to work on such an exciting project, and for the help and guidance given to me throughout the project. Dr. Saikat Maity for the various times he has answered my queries, and for lending me several pieces of equipment. Mr. Nilanjan Roy for taking some excellent photos for the presentation . Lastly thanked to my group friends for their valuable ideas and input into project meetings.</h3>
<h2><li><u>COSTS:</u></li></h2>
<h3>The only monetary costs for the entire project were the initial purchasing of the components to construct the drone. The price of the parts necessitated the acquisition of funds from JIS University , computer science and engineering department. A proposal was given to Dr. Mainak Biswas . The project received Rs. 1000 of funding as a result. Beyond that, only time on the part of the team was necessary to complete the software section of the project.</h3>

<h2><u><li>CONCLUSION:</u></li></h2>
<h3>Given the increasing number of drones in the sky and the fact that banning drones from society is not a realistic option, the discussion in this chapter focused on how to regulate and channel the use of drones. This can be accomplished by considering conditions and contents of future drone legislation and by analyzing privacy and other safeguards that can be taken. Conditions for future drone legislation include creating policy visions, further integration of aviation laws, telecommunication laws and criminal justice laws, regulation on international levels, mandatory evaluations and (to some extent) technology-independent legislation. The contents of future drone legislation should focus on aviation law, privacy law, liability law and criminal law. Privacy safeguards include privacy impact assessments and the use of privacy by design, most notably geofencing. Other safeguards include mandatory education for some groups of drone users and raising public awareness.</h3>
